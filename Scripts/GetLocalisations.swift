 Extracts specific localised strings from Apple’s glossary files.

 This script helped with localisation for KeyboardKit (https://github.com/douglashill/KeyboardKit) by leveraging Apple’s existing translations.

 More detail in the article at https://douglashill.co/localisation-using-apples-glossaries/

 It reads each needed translation by looking up translations for specific keys in specific glossary files.

 ## Adapting for other projects

 1. Set the outputDirectory below.
 2. Change neededLocalisations to the keys your project needs.

 ## Generating the .strings files

 1. Download all macOS and iOS glossary DMGs from the Apple Developer website (sign in required): https://developer.apple.com/download/more
 2. Mount all of these DMGs on your Mac. There should be about 80. DiskImageMounter may get stuck if you try mounting ~20 or more at once, so opening in batches of ~15 is recommended.
 3. Run this script. Look out for any errors in the console. That may indicate some DMGs failed to mount, or Apple removed a localisation key or added one so the lookup is ambiguous.
 4. Manually edit all the .strings file for quality of translation. Pay special attention to American English (en.lproj) because it’s generated from Australian English.

 ## Adding new localised strings

 1. Locate the same text used in Apple software and identify the glossary where this can be found and the key used.
 2. Add this as a `NeededLocalisation` in the `neededLocalisations` array in the script `main.swift`. This order of this array is matches the final order in the `.strings` files. It should be sorted alphabetically by key.
 3. Follow the steps for generating above.
